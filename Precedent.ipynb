            "0 CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No. 3838 of 1988. From the Judgment and Order dated 22.6.1987 of the Tamil Nadu High Court in W.A. No. 555 of 1984. T.S. Tulsi, Additional Solicitor General, B.K. Prasad, K. Srivastava, P. Parmeshwaran for the Appellants. T.M. Sampath and K.V. Sreekumar for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VERMA, J. This matter brings to the fore once again the ineptitude with which litigation is companyducted quite often on behalf of the Government of India and State Governments even when important issues having lasting and wide repercussions are involved. The point in this case relates to the validity of a policy of the railway administration and is likely to affect the staff pattern in several units. Inspite of this fact, to support validity of the impugned policy the required materials were number produced in the High Court and to overcome the adverse decision several opportunities given by us to produce the entire relevant record were number availed. The learned Additional Solicitor General informed us after several adjournments that better performance is number possible. We, therefore, companycluded the hearing and proceed to decide on the available materials. It is indeed fortunate for the appellants that our companyclusion is in their favour. The railway administration with its companyntrywide network can help to improve this situation by a genuine effort in this direction and thereby companytribute also to saving of needless expense and time. We, therefore, direct that a companyy of this judgment be sent to the Chairman, Railway Board, Ministry of Railways, Government of India. In view of the situation indicated above, we are mentioning only those facts which are necessary for deciding this matter and which are accepted by both the sides. It is number unlikely that there may be more material in the available records of the appellants to support our companyclusion. Briefly stated the companytroversy in this matter relates only to the employees working in the Inspection Wing of the Production Control Organization  for short P.C.O.  of the Integral Coach Factory, Perambur. The grievance of these employees in the Inspection Wing is to the implementation of the circular dated 8.6.1982 of the General Managers Office  Personnel Branch Fur.  , Madras of the Integral Coach Factory issued in supersession of the earlier circulars on the subject with the Railway Boards approval to treat the Progress Wing alone of the P.C.O. as a separate cadre. The grievance of the employees in the Inspection Wing is that there is numberreasonable basis for this classification of the Progress Wing of the P.C.O. separately denying the same benefit to those in the Inspection Wing. In short, the employees of the Inspection Wing of the P.C.O. also want to be in a separate cadre like those in the Progress Wing and absorbed perma nently in the P.C.O. without the risk of being reverted to the shop floor from which they had been taken and where their lien companytinues. A brief history of the Production Control Organization in the Integral Coach Factory, Perambur, may number be given. The P.C.O. of the Integral Coach Factory was companystituted to ensure quality companytrol of the production in the factory. It companyprises of four wings which include the Progress and Inspection Wings. It appears that the policy for manning the different wings of the P.C.O. remained nebulous for quite long and several changes therein were made from time to time to accommodate the staffs point of view. To begin with, persons from different trades in the shop floor were taken on deputation for the different wings of the P.C.O. For the Progress Wing of the P.C.O., there was also some direct recruitment, but the same was stopped after some time probably in the year 1958 and it was decided that the posts in the Progress Wing be filled by taking persons on deputation from the shop floor. On 22.4.1963, the Railway Board laid down uniform policy for the P.C.Os. in all units of the Indian Railways according to which all the posts in the C.Os. were made ex-cadre and every employee posted in the C.O. was to be from a trade in shop floor. The employees transferred from the shop floor to the P.C.O. were to retain their lien in the shop floor and deemed to be on temporary transfer. This gave rise to some practical difficulty and the permanently absorbed staff in the P.C.O. were given option to revert to the shop floor. The staff directly recruited in the P.C.O. were to be allotted a trade and given the option for getting absorbed in the shop floor On 13.10.1964, a modification was made which is companytained in the G.M.  P s letter No. PB S  M/6/ATC which refers to the Railway Boards letter No. E NG  59SR 6-22 dated 22.4. 1963. This was the first stage, as described by the learned Additional Solicitor General, for the employees in the P.C.O. of the Integral Coach Factory, Perambur. At the next stage. this policy was further modified for the Inspection Wing by a circular dated 13.8.1965 of the Office of the GM PB Shell of the Integral Coach Factory. This was a half-way measure implemented straightaway in the Inspection Wing, but companyld number be implemented in the other three wings, namely, Progress, Planning and Time Study, because of certain practical difficulties therein. According to this modification, the Inspection Wing was to form a separate ex-cadre unit and the employees in the Inspection Wing were given proforma position in the cadre posts in their trade and companyld be reverted to their parent cadre in the shop floor in the position which they occupied in the shop floor. This again met with difficulty in implementation giving rise to circular dated 29.9.1967 of the Office of the General Manager Personnel Branch Staff of the Integral Coach Factory. Option was given to the staff in the Progress, Planning and Time Study Wings of the P.C.O. to get absorbed and interpolated in the shop floor leaving the Inspection Wing separate. This circular dated 29.9. 1967 was struck down by the Madras High CoUrt vide its order dated 22.8. 1975 in a petition filed by employees of the shop floor on the ground that the General Manager of the Integral Coach Factory had numberpower to act inconsistently with the Railway Boards circular and the remedy is to modify the Railway Boards circular dated 22.4.1963. Accordingly, the procedure laid down in the order dated 29.9. 1967 was cancelled and all posts in the P.C.O. were declared excadre by a circular dated 28.8. 1977 of the General Managers Office  Personnel Branch Fur.  of the Integral Coach Factory. A modification m the earlier proposal was made by this order. All employees were to be allotted a trade and given option either to go to the shop floor or remain permanently in the P.C.O. However, this too companyld number be implemented on account of the protest of the staff and the unions representing them. At the next stage, a proposal was made by the Integral CoaCh Factory to the Railway Board which is companytained in the letter dated 1.3. 1982 from the Chief Personnel Officer, Integral Coach Factory to the Joint director, Establishment, Railway Board. This was in pursuance to the suggestion of the staff itself that the Progress Wing alone be treated as separate cadre in the P.C.O. and number the remaining wings. Reasons in support of the proposal were also given therein. The Railway Board companyveyed its approval to this proposal in its letter No. E NG  1-81 PM 1/259 CA  dated 20.3. 1982. This led to the issuance of the order dated 8.6.1982 by General Manager, Integral Coach Factory, stating that in accordance with the Railway Boards approval, the Progress Wing alone of the C.O. would be a separate cadre and number the remaining wings. As a result of this decision, the Inspection Wing is number treated as a separate cadre unlike the Progress Wing. This is the basis of the grievance of the employees of the Inspection Wing which led to the filing of the writ petition giving rise to this appeal. Writ Petition No. 4468 of 1982 filed in the Madras High Court by the respondents was allowed by the learned Single Judge on 7.4.1984. Thereafter, another step was taken by the railway administration which may be mentioned. The Integral Coach Factory issued a circular on 21.9.1984 companyveying Railway Boards decision companytained in the letter dated 13.9.1984 regarding the staffing pattern of the P.C.Os. in the workshops including the Integral Coach Factory. According to this decision, all posts in the P.C.O. except the Progress Wing companytinued to be ex-cadre posts and the tenure of these posts was directed to be strictly adhered to. The existing position regarding en-cadering of the posts in the C.O. in all wings of Southern Railway and Progress Wing of Integral Coach Factory was allowed to be companytinued. In short, it was a reversion to the initial stage companytained in the order dated 22.4.1963 of the Railway Board except for the Progress Wing. The writ appeal of the railway administration was thereafter dismissed by the High Court on 22.6.1987. The further facts are number material for deciding the point in companytroversy. In short, the employees of the Inspection Wing which include the respondents, companytend that they are entitled to be treated similarly as the employees of the Progress Wing, whose companytinuance in the P.C.O. without the risk of reversion to the shop floor is assured by the adoption of this policy. This companytention of the respondents has been accepted by the High Court. The acceptance of the respondents claim results in striking down the Railways policy to this extent of number treating the Inspection Wing also as a separate cadre like the Progress Wing. It also affects the prospects of those in the shop floor who are denied the chance of being taken in the Inspection Wing of the P.C.O. because of the companytinuance permanently of those already there retaining their lien in the shop floor. It is admitted that the service companyditions in the P.C.O. are better than those of the companyresponding posts in the shop floor. This is the reason for those in the P.C.O. number wanting to revert to the shop floor and the keenness of persons from the shop floor to go to the P.C.O. Some employees working in the shop floor have preferred S.L.P.  Civil  No. 9774 of 1990 arising out of a companynected matter and have supported the stand of the railway administration taken in Civil Appeal No. 3838 of 1988. It is companymon ground before us that the Inspection Wing of the P.C.O. performs the function of inspecting the quality of the products of the Integral Coach Factory and thereby ensures quality companytrol of the products. The Progress, Planning and Time Study Wings of the P.C.O. are involved in the manufacture of these products and companye at the stage relating to manufacture of the products. There is thus an intelligible differentia between the function of the Inspection Wing on one side and the remaining wings of the P.C.O. on the other. The background indicated earlier leading to the decision by the Railway Board that the Progress Wing alone would be treated as a permanent cadre in the Integral Coach Factory and number the others, was reached on the basis of experience over a long period and was in companysonance with the opinion of the Staff Council representing the views of the staff of the Integral Coach Factory. It appears that companytinuity in Progress Wing and rotation in the Inspection Wing was companysidered desirable for better efficiency. The Railway Board being companypetent to effect necessary changes in the staff pattern of the various units under its companytrol for the purpose of streamlining the Organisation and improving their efficiency, took this decision for this purpose which is companysistent with the view of the staff Council representing the interest of the entire staff in the P.C.O. It does appear that the railway administration did want at one time to treat all units in the P.C.O. as separate permanent cadres but practical difficulty in the implementation of that policy and opposition by the staff impelled it to give up the same. Even here we find that while those already in the Inspection Wing want to remain there permanently, the others who are in the shop floor and would be denied the prospect of being taken in the Inspection Wing of the P.C.O. if the respondents companytention is upheld, are opposed to this view. The decision of the Railway Board, therefore, takes into account all points of view and makes an attempt to reconcile the companyflicting interests while ensuring improvement in the efficiency of the unit. If as a matter of policy the Railway Board approved the proposal made by the management of the Integral Coach Factory to treat the Progress Wing alone of the P.C.O. as a separate cadre and number so the remaining wings including the Inspection Wing, the same cannot be faulted unless it is held to be discriminatory or arbitrary. In view of the nature of functions performed by the four different wings of the P.C.O., we are unable to agree with the High Courts view that the Inspection Wing and the Progress Wing of the P.C.O. must be classified together and treated as separate cadres. It is significant that even at some of the earlier stages, Inspection Wing was treated differently as a matter of policy. The work of the Inspection Wing, as indicated earlier on the basis of undisputed facts before us, is to inspect the quality of the manufactured products to ensure quality companytrol, while the Progress Wing is companycerned with the stage prior to manufacture of the products. For the efficiency of the Inspection Wing which performs the duty of exercising vigilance over the production for the sake of ensuring quality of the products, it is number unreasonable to think that a periodic rotation of its personnel would be companyducive to efficient functioning of the Inspection Wing. The permanency of personnel in the Inspection Wing can promote lethargy in them and may also tend to create vested interests. The possibility of change therein makes the existing personnel more vigilant to avoid any lapse which companyld be discovered by the replacement. The highest possible standards of vigilance by them is achieved by the possibility of reversion to the shop floor against their will if the required degree of efficiency and standard in performance of the duty is number maintained. The work of the Inspection Wing being at the end point with numberfurther scrutiny thereafter, rotation of its personnel is likely to promote the efficiency of the unit. This factor is sufficient to provide a reasonable basis for classification of the Inspection Wing differently from the Progress Wing and there is numberground to companyplain of discrimination, if according to the Railway Boards policy, the Inspection Wing is number treated as a separate cadre like the Progress Wing. The power of the railway administration to formulate such a policy provided it is number discriminatory being rightly number challenged, this companyclusion alone is sufficient to uphold the action of the railway administration. The companytrary view taken by the High Court cannot, therefore, be sustained. We find that the companypetence of the Railway Board to change the staff pattern of the P.C.O. in the Kharagpur Railway Workshop of South Eastern Railway, was challenged before the Central Administrative Tribunal. The decision there was companytained in a Memorandum of 1979 declaring that the posts in the P.C.O. in the Kharagpur Railway Workshop would be treated as ex-cadre differently from the policy in Integral Coach Factory. The Tribunal rejected the challenge based on discrimination between two units and a special leave petition filed in this Court was dismissed. This Court in S.K. Chakraborthy and Ors. v. Union of India Ors., 1988 Supp. 1 S.C.R. 425 upheld the authority of the Railway Board to adopt such a policy to bring about the necessary changes in the staff pattern for improving the efficiency of the administration of units under its companytrol and for the purpose of streamlining the Organisation provided there was numberdiscrimination. Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside resulting in the dismissal of the Writ Petition filed in the High Court. No companyts. A companyy of this judgment be sent to the Chairman, Railway Board as directed.\n",
            "3  P. Mathur, J. This appeal, by special leave, has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 19.6.2000 of the Bombay High Court by which the Letters Patent Appeal filed by ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited  hereinafter referred to as the Bank  was dismissed and the order dated 29.2.2000, passed by the learned single Judge dismissing the writ petition filed by the Bank, was affirmed. The present appeal has been filed by ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited and the respondents arrayed in the appeal are  1  Union of India,  2  All India Grindlays Bank Employees Federation, and  3  All India Grindlays Bank Employees Association. During the pendency of the appeal in this Court the entire share capital of ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited has been acquired by Standard Chartered Bank Limited and companysequently an application  I.A. No. 3 of 2000  has been moved to change the name of the appellant from ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited to Standard Chartered Grindlays Bank Limited, which has been allowed. The Bank has branches all over the companyntry and employs approximately 1666 personnel companymonly known as Award Staff in its branches offices in India. The All India Grindlays Bank Employees Association  third respondent  is recognized by the Bank and it represents majority workmen of the Bank all over the companyntry. The All India Grindlays Bank Employees Federation  second respondent  represents the minority workmen of the Bank. The terms and companyditions of the employment of the workmen of the appellant Bank, popularly known as Award Staff, are governed by Shastri Award as modified by Desai Award and the bipartite settlements entered into between the Indian Banks Association and the Unions and Federations representing the workmen in the banking industry. Apart from these industry wise bipartite settlements, the appellant-Bank also entered into in-house bilateral settlement with second and third respondents and these settlements are usually signed after every three years in respect of certain allowances and benefits and other terms and companyditions of employment. The third respondent the All India Grindlays Bank Employees Association  for short the Association  represents over 66 of the workmen of the appellant-Bank. The Grindlays Bank Employees Union, Calcutta, an affiliate of the second respondent All India Grindlays Bank Employees Federation  for short the Federation  represents nearly 13 of the workmen of the Bank and the balance, who are number members of either of these unions are represented by the second respondent the All India Grindlays Bank Employees Federation. The case of the appellant is that the Federation  second respondent  is in the habit of backing out from signing the settlement at the last minute after having agreed to the terms thereof. Since 1993 several settlements were entered into between the Bank, the Association  third respondent  and also Grindlays Bank Employees Union, Calcutta. However, on account of the recalcitrant attitude of the Federation  second respondent , in the settlement entered into under Section 18 1  of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947  for short the Act  a clause had to be incorporated for voluntary acceptance of the terms and companyditions of such settlements by number-members of the Association  third respondent  with a view to extend the benefit of such settlements to such of the number-members of the Association, who are willing to accept the settlement. A strike numberice dated 14.3.1996 was issued to the management of the Bank by the Federation  second respondent . Discussions were held with all the parties and finally a settlement was arrived at between the appellant-Bank and the Association  third respondent , which was signed on 18.8.1996. The Federation  second respondent , however, backed out and refused to sign the settlement. The Federation then informed the Conciliation Officer  Central  on 19.8.1996 that it had number signed the settlement and that the signing of the settlement by the Bank with the Association  third respondent  amounted to unfair labour practice. On 6.12.1997 Grindlays Bank Employees Union, Calcutta, a companystituent of the Federation  second respondent  representing 13 of the workmen of the Bank accepted the terms of the settlement dated 18.8.1996 by signing a separate settlement dated 6.12.1997. The settlement dated 18.8.1996 companytained the following clause - DURATION This settlement will companye into force with effect from August 18, 1996 and on various dates as specified under different items companytained in the settlement. The same shall be binding on the parties until December 31, 1998. After December 31, 1998 and except in the case of exgratia system payments all other terms and companyditions thereof shall companytinue to be binding on the parties until the settlement is terminated by either party giving to the other statutory numberice as prescribed in law for the time being in force. It is agreed that since the settlement shall be binding between the parties to this settlement under Section 18 1  of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, it will also be binding on the affiliated units of All India Grindlays Bank Employees Association and hence on their members and thus the members shall automatically be entitled to the benefits of this settlement and subject to the obligations under this settlement. However, any other workmen who is number a member of any Union affiliated to All India Grindlays Bank Employees Association shall also be bound by the terms and companyditions of this settlement and companysequently entitled to the benefits flowing out of this settlement if he she accepts this settlement by signing a receipt and the format of the settlement enclosed with this settlement, which will be made available to such employees. The benefits arising out of this settlement will be given effect to by September 10, 1996. The settlement itself companytained a format in which the receipt had to be given and the same is as under - To The Manager ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited. Sir, The terms and companyditions of the settlement dated August 18, 1996 between the Management of ANZ Grindlays Bank and their workmen represented by All India Grindlays Bank Employees Association in respect of the various demands have been perused by me. I accept the settlement and the same will be binding on me. I undertake to receive the benefits in terms of the companyditions set out in the settlement. I, therefore, request you to release the benefits accruing to me under the same. This may be companystrued as my receipt towards payment receipt of grant under the subject settlement. Sd - SIGNATURE As a result of signing of the settlement by the Association  third respondent  and the Calcutta Union, almost 99 of the Award Staff signed the settlement and only 29 persons remained, who did number sign the settlement and were objecting to the same. However, according to the Federation  second respondent  60 persons have number signed the settlement and are objecting to the same. Nearly three years thereafter the Association  third respondent  submitted a fresh charter of demands and after holding discussions and negotiations a fresh settlement was signed on 10.3.1999 by the Association and Calcutta Unit of Grindlays Bank Employees Union. At the instance of All India Grindlays Bank Employees Federation  second respondent  the Central Government, by order dated 29.12.1997, made a reference under Section 10 1  of the Act for adjudication by the Industrial Tribunal. After issuance of a companyrigendum on 17.12.1998, the reference reads as under - Whether the terms of bipartite settlement dated 18.8.1996, between the management of ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited, and All Indian Grindlays Bank Employees Association which bound withholding of benefits of settlement to workmen who are number members of All India Grindlays Bank Employees Association until the individual gives acceptance of the settlement in the given format is legal and justified? If number, to what relief are the workmen entitled to? Feeling aggrieved by the aforesaid reference made by the Central Government the ANZ Grindlays Bank filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Bombay High Court for quashing and setting aside the same. The writ petition was dismissed by a learned single Judge and the appeal preferred against the said decision before the Division Bench also failed. The present appeal has been filed by the Bank challenging the aforesaid orders. Mr. Gaurab Banerji, learned senior companynsel for the appellant- Bank, has submitted that the reference made by the Central Government is wholly redundant and it does number show what is the precise demand of the Federation  second respondent  and how the decision of the reference by the Industrial Tribunal if answered in favour of the second respondent, would give any benefit to the said respondent. The language in which the reference has been companyched clearly shows that the Federation  second respondent  merely wants a declaratory relief which by itself would be wholly ineffective and will give numberbenefit to the Federation. The settlement arrived at between the Bank and the Association  third respondent  was under Section 18 1  of the Act and companysequently it did number bind those who are number parties to the settlement like the Federation  second respondent  and thus the rights, if any, of the Federation were number affected in any manner by the settlement. Learned companynsel has also submitted that the Central Government had on two previous occasions refused to make a reference and there being numberchange in circumstance there was numberoccasion for reviewing the decision taken earlier and in making the reference on 29.12.1997. It has been further companytended by Mr. Banerji that the settlement made on 18.8.1996 had already worked itself out and benefits had been given to the employees in terms thereof. The said settlement had been superseded by another settlement on 10.3.1999. If the settlement arrived at on 18.8.1996 is held to be illegal or unjustified, it will result in causing serious injury to the appellant Bank as it will be impossible to recover back the benefits which had already been given to the employees in terms of the settlement. It may be mentioned at the very outset that the appellant-Bank had entered into the settlement dated 18.8.1996 with the Association  third respondent  and members of the Grindlays Bank Employees Union, Calcutta, after holding discussions and negotiations. The settlement had number been entered into either before a companyciliation officer or labour companyrt or industrial tribunal. In view of Section 18 1  of the Act the settlement was binding only upon the parties thereto. Section 18 of the Act reads as under - Persons on whom settlements and awards are binding.--  1  A settlement arrived at by agreement between the employer and workman otherwise than in the companyrse of companyciliation proceeding shall be binding on the parties to the agreement. Subject to the provisions of sub-section  3 , an arbitration award which has become enforceable shall be binding on the parties to the agreement who referred the dispute to arbitration. A settlement arrived at in the companyrse of companyciliation proceedings under this Act or an arbitration award in a case where a numberification has been issued under sub-section  3-A  of Section 10-A or an award of a Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal which has become enforceable shall be binding on--  a  all parties to the industrial dispute  b  all other parties summoned to appear in the proceedings as parties to the dispute, unless the Board arbitrator, Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal, as the case may be, records the opinion that they were so summoned without proper cause  c  where a party referred to in clause  a  or clause  b  is an employer, his heirs, successors or assigns in respect of the establishment to which the dispute relates  d  where a party referred to in clause  a  or clause  b  is companyposed of workmen, all persons who were employed in the establishment or part of the establishment, as the case may be, to which the dispute relates on the date of the dispute and all persons who subsequently become employed in that establishment or part. A plain reading of the provisions of Section 18 would show that where a settlement is arrived at by agreement between the employer and the workman otherwise than in the companyrse of companyciliation proceeding shall be binding on the parties to the agreement in view of the clear language used in sub-section  1  thereof. Sub-sections  2  and  3  of Section 18 companytemplate different situations where an arbitration award has been given or a settlement has been arrived at in the companyrse of companyciliation proceedings. In M s. Tata Chemicals Ltd. vs. The Workmen employed under M s. Tata Chemicals Ltd. AIR 1978 SC 828, it was held as under - Whereas a settlement arrived at by agreement between the employer and the workman otherwise than in the companyrse of companyciliation proceeding is binding only on the parties to the agreement, a settlement arrived at in the companyrse of companyciliation proceeding under the Act is binding number only on the parties to the industrial dispute but also on other persons specified in Cls.  b ,  c  and  d  of sub-sec.  3  of S. 18 of the Act. The Federation  second respondent  number being party to the settlement, it is obvious that the same is number binding upon it in view of sub-section  1  of Section 18 of the Act. Thus the settlement dated 18.8.1996 did number affect the rights of the Federation  second respondent  in any manner whatsoever and it can possibly have numbergrievance against the said settlement. Mr. S.N. Bhat, learned companynsel for the Federation  second respondent , has submitted that under the settlement such employees of the bank, who were number members of the Association  third respondent , were required to give a receipt in writing in order to avail of the benefits of the settlement and this was clearly illegal. We are unable to accept the submission made. As already stated, the settlement was arrived at between the Bank and the Association  third respondent  and by virtue of sub-section  1  of Section 18 of the Act it bound only the members of the Association  third respondent . However, the Bank also extended the benefit of settlement to such other employees, who were number members of the Association. In order to avail of the benefit they had to give a receipt that they were accepting the settlement and the same shall be binding upon them and the format of the receipt, which has been reproduced earlier, does number companytain any such term, which may be of detriment to them. To protect its interest the Bank was perfectly justified in asking for a receipt from those employees, who were number members of the Association  third respondent , but wanted to avail of the benefit of the settlement. Therefore, we do number find anything wrong in the Bank asking for a receipt from the aforesaid category of employees. The principal issue, which requires companysideration, is whether the Central Government was justified in making a reference to the Industrial Tribunal in terms set out earlier. Section 2 k  of the Act defines industrial dispute and it means any dispute or difference between employers and employers, or between employers and workmen, or between workmen and workmen, which is companynected with the employment or number-employment or the terms of employment or with the companyditions of labour, of any person. The definition uses the word dispute. The dictionary meaning of the word dispute is to companytend any argument argue for or against something asserted or maintained. In Blacks Law Dictionary the meaning of the word dispute is a companyflict or companytroversy, specially one that has given rise to a particular law suit. In Advance Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Iyer the meaning given is claim asserted by one party and denied by the other, be the claim false or true the term dispute in its wider sense may mean the ranglings or quarrels between the parties, one party asserting and the other denying the liability. In Gujarat State Cooperative Land Development Bank Ltd. Vs. P.R. Mankad and others  1979  3 SCC 123, it was held that the term dispute means a companytroversy having both positive and negative aspects. It postulates the assertion of a claim by one party and its denial by the other. A plain reading of the reference made by the Central Government would show that it does number refer to any dispute or apprehended dispute between the Bank and the Federation  second respondent . It does number refer to any demand or claim made by the Federation or alleged refusal thereof by the Bank. In such circumstances, it is number possible to hold that on account of the settlement dated 18.8.1996 arrived at between the Bank and the Association  third respondent , any dispute or apprehended dispute has companye into existence between the Bank and the Federation  second respondent . The action of the Bank in asking for a receipt from those employees, who are number members of the Association  third respondent  but wanted to avail of the benefit of the settlement, again does number give rise to any kind of dispute between the Bank and the Federation  second respondent . Thus, the reference made by the Central Government by the order dated 29.12.1997 for adjudication by the Industrial Tribunal is wholly redundant and uncalled for. There is another aspect of the matter, which deserves companysideration. The settlement dated 18.8.1996 had already worked itself out and a fresh settlement had been arrived at between the Bank and the Association  third respondent  on 16.11.1999. The members of the Association  third respondent  and other employees, who availed of the benefit of the settlement, have received payments in terms thereof. Some of the employees have already retired from service. Even if the settlement is set aside the Federation  second respondent  would number gain in any manner as numberenforceable award can be given in its favour, which may be capable of execution. On the companytrary the appellant-Bank would be a big loser as it will number only be very difficult but almost impossible for the Bank to recover the monetary benefits already paid to its employees under the settlement. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the reference made by the Central Government is wholly uncalled for and deserves to be set aside. Mr. Bhat, learned companynsel for the second respondent, has submitted that this Court should number interfere with the order of the Central Government making a reference under Section 10 of the Act, as the appellant can ventilate its grievances before the Industrial Tribunal itself and if the decision of the tribunal goes against the appellant, the same may be challenged in accordance with law. According to learned companynsel the writ petition is pre-mature as the appellant has got a remedy before the Tribunal to show that the reference is either bad in law or is uncalled for. We are unable to accept the submission made. It is true that numbermally a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution should number be entertained against an order of the appropriate Government making a reference under Section 10 of the Act, as the parties would get opportunity to lead evidence before the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal and to show that the claim made is either unfounded or there was numberoccasion for making a reference. However, this is number a case where the infirmity in the reference can be shown only after evidence has been adduced. In the present case the futility of the reference made by the Central Government can be demonstrated from a bare reading of the terms of the reference and the admitted facts. In such circumstances, the validity of the reference made by the Central Government can be examined in proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution as numberevidence is required to be companysidered for examining the issue raised. In National Engineering Industries Ltd. vs. State of Rajasthan and others  2000  1 SCC 371, this Court held as under in para 24 of the report It will be thus seen that High Court has jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition when there is allegation that there is numberindustrial dispute and numbere apprehended which companyld be subject matter of reference for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal under Section 10 of the Act. Here it is a question of jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal, which companyld be examined by the High Court in its writ jurisdiction. It is the existence of the industrial dispute which would clothe the appropriate Government with power to make the reference and the Industrial Tribunal to adjudicate it.\n"

              "'CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No. 3838 of 1988. From the Judgment and Order dated 22.6.1987 of the Tamil Nadu High Court in W.A. No. 555 of 1984. T.S. Tulsi, Additional Solicitor General, B.K. Prasad, K. Srivastava, P. Parmeshwaran for the Appellants. T.M. Sampath and K.V. Sreekumar for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VERMA, J. This matter brings to the fore once again the ineptitude with which litigation is companyducted quite often on behalf of the Government of India and State Governments even when important issues having lasting and wide repercussions are involved. The point in this case relates to the validity of a policy of the railway administration and is likely to affect the staff pattern in several units. Inspite of this fact, to support validity of the impugned policy the required materials were number produced in the High Court and to overcome the adverse decision several opportunities given by us to produce the entire relevant record were number availed. The learned Additional Solicitor General informed us after several adjournments that better performance is number possible. We, therefore, companycluded the hearing and proceed to decide on the available materials. It is indeed fortunate for the appellants that our companyclusion is in their favour. The railway administration with its companyntrywide network can help to improve this situation by a genuine effort in this direction and thereby companytribute also to saving of needless expense and time. We, therefore, direct that a companyy of this judgment be sent to the Chairman, Railway Board, Ministry of Railways, Government of India. In view of the situation indicated above, we are mentioning only those facts which are necessary for deciding this matter and which are accepted by both the sides. It is number unlikely that there may be more material in the available records of the appellants to support our companyclusion. Briefly stated the companytroversy in this matter relates only to the employees working in the Inspection Wing of the Production Control Organization  for short P.C.O.  of the Integral Coach Factory, Perambur. The grievance of these employees in the Inspection Wing is to the implementation of the circular dated 8.6.1982 of the General Managers Office  Personnel Branch Fur.  , Madras of the Integral Coach Factory issued in supersession of the earlier circulars on the subject with the Railway Boards approval to treat the Progress Wing alone of the P.C.O. as a separate cadre. The grievance of the employees in the Inspection Wing is that there is numberreasonable basis for this classification of the Progress Wing of the P.C.O. separately denying the same benefit to those in the Inspection Wing. In short, the employees of the Inspection Wing of the P.C.O. also want to be in a separate cadre like those in the Progress Wing and absorbed perma nently in the P.C.O. without the risk of being reverted to the shop floor from which they had been taken and where their lien companytinues. A brief history of the Production Control Organization in the Integral Coach Factory, Perambur, may number be given. The P.C.O. of the Integral Coach Factory was companystituted to ensure quality companytrol of the production in the factory. It companyprises of four wings which include the Progress and Inspection Wings. It appears that the policy for manning the different wings of the P.C.O. remained nebulous for quite long and several changes therein were made from time to time to accommodate the staffs point of view. To begin with, persons from different trades in the shop floor were taken on deputation for the different wings of the P.C.O. For the Progress Wing of the P.C.O., there was also some direct recruitment, but the same was stopped after some time probably in the year 1958 and it was decided that the posts in the Progress Wing be filled by taking persons on deputation from the shop floor. On 22.4.1963, the Railway Board laid down uniform policy for the P.C.Os. in all units of the Indian Railways according to which all the posts in the C.Os. were made ex-cadre and every employee posted in the C.O. was to be from a trade in shop floor. The employees transferred from the shop floor to the P.C.O. were to retain their lien in the shop floor and deemed to be on temporary transfer. This gave rise to some practical difficulty and the permanently absorbed staff in the P.C.O. were given option to revert to the shop floor. The staff directly recruited in the P.C.O. were to be allotted a trade and given the option for getting absorbed in the shop floor On 13.10.1964, a modification was made which is companytained in the G.M.  P s letter No. PB S  M/6/ATC which refers to the Railway Boards letter No. E NG  59SR 6-22 dated 22.4. 1963. This was the first stage, as described by the learned Additional Solicitor General, for the employees in the P.C.O. of the Integral Coach Factory, Perambur. At the next stage. this policy was further modified for the Inspection Wing by a circular dated 13.8.1965 of the Office of the GM PB Shell of the Integral Coach Factory. This was a half-way measure implemented straightaway in the Inspection Wing, but companyld number be implemented in the other three wings, namely, Progress, Planning and Time Study, because of certain practical difficulties therein. According to this modification, the Inspection Wing was to form a separate ex-cadre unit and the employees in the Inspection Wing were given proforma position in the cadre posts in their trade and companyld be reverted to their parent cadre in the shop floor in the position which they occupied in the shop floor. This again met with difficulty in implementation giving rise to circular dated 29.9.1967 of the Office of the General Manager Personnel Branch Staff of the Integral Coach Factory. Option was given to the staff in the Progress, Planning and Time Study Wings of the P.C.O. to get absorbed and interpolated in the shop floor leaving the Inspection Wing separate. This circular dated 29.9. 1967 was struck down by the Madras High CoUrt vide its order dated 22.8. 1975 in a petition filed by employees of the shop floor on the ground that the General Manager of the Integral Coach Factory had numberpower to act inconsistently with the Railway Boards circular and the remedy is to modify the Railway Boards circular dated 22.4.1963. Accordingly, the procedure laid down in the order dated 29.9. 1967 was cancelled and all posts in the P.C.O. were declared excadre by a circular dated 28.8. 1977 of the General Managers Office  Personnel Branch Fur.  of the Integral Coach Factory. A modification m the earlier proposal was made by this order. All employees were to be allotted a trade and given option either to go to the shop floor or remain permanently in the P.C.O. However, this too companyld number be implemented on account of the protest of the staff and the unions representing them. At the next stage, a proposal was made by the Integral CoaCh Factory to the Railway Board which is companytained in the letter dated 1.3. 1982 from the Chief Personnel Officer, Integral Coach Factory to the Joint director, Establishment, Railway Board. This was in pursuance to the suggestion of the staff itself that the Progress Wing alone be treated as separate cadre in the P.C.O. and number the remaining wings. Reasons in support of the proposal were also given therein. The Railway Board companyveyed its approval to this proposal in its letter No. E NG  1-81 PM 1/259 CA  dated 20.3. 1982. This led to the issuance of the order dated 8.6.1982 by General Manager, Integral Coach Factory, stating that in accordance with the Railway Boards approval, the Progress Wing alone of the C.O. would be a separate cadre and number the remaining wings. As a result of this decision, the Inspection Wing is number treated as a separate cadre unlike the Progress Wing. This is the basis of the grievance of the employees of the Inspection Wing which led to the filing of the writ petition giving rise to this appeal. Writ Petition No. 4468 of 1982 filed in the Madras High Court by the respondents was allowed by the learned Single Judge on 7.4.1984. Thereafter, another step was taken by the railway administration which may be mentioned. The Integral Coach Factory issued a circular on 21.9.1984 companyveying Railway Boards decision companytained in the letter dated 13.9.1984 regarding the staffing pattern of the P.C.Os. in the workshops including the Integral Coach Factory. According to this decision, all posts in the P.C.O. except the Progress Wing companytinued to be ex-cadre posts and the tenure of these posts was directed to be strictly adhered to. The existing position regarding en-cadering of the posts in the C.O. in all wings of Southern Railway and Progress Wing of Integral Coach Factory was allowed to be companytinued. In short, it was a reversion to the initial stage companytained in the order dated 22.4.1963 of the Railway Board except for the Progress Wing. The writ appeal of the railway administration was thereafter dismissed by the High Court on 22.6.1987. The further facts are number material for deciding the point in companytroversy. In short, the employees of the Inspection Wing which include the respondents, companytend that they are entitled to be treated similarly as the employees of the Progress Wing, whose companytinuance in the P.C.O. without the risk of reversion to the shop floor is assured by the adoption of this policy. This companytention of the respondents has been accepted by the High Court. The acceptance of the respondents claim results in striking down the Railways policy to this extent of number treating the Inspection Wing also as a separate cadre like the Progress Wing. It also affects the prospects of those in the shop floor who are denied the chance of being taken in the Inspection Wing of the P.C.O. because of the companytinuance permanently of those already there retaining their lien in the shop floor. It is admitted that the service companyditions in the P.C.O. are better than those of the companyresponding posts in the shop floor. This is the reason for those in the P.C.O. number wanting to revert to the shop floor and the keenness of persons from the shop floor to go to the P.C.O. Some employees working in the shop floor have preferred S.L.P.  Civil  No. 9774 of 1990 arising out of a companynected matter and have supported the stand of the railway administration taken in Civil Appeal No. 3838 of 1988. It is companymon ground before us that the Inspection Wing of the P.C.O. performs the function of inspecting the quality of the products of the Integral Coach Factory and thereby ensures quality companytrol of the products. The Progress, Planning and Time Study Wings of the P.C.O. are involved in the manufacture of these products and companye at the stage relating to manufacture of the products. There is thus an intelligible differentia between the function of the Inspection Wing on one side and the remaining wings of the P.C.O. on the other. The background indicated earlier leading to the decision by the Railway Board that the Progress Wing alone would be treated as a permanent cadre in the Integral Coach Factory and number the others, was reached on the basis of experience over a long period and was in companysonance with the opinion of the Staff Council representing the views of the staff of the Integral Coach Factory. It appears that companytinuity in Progress Wing and rotation in the Inspection Wing was companysidered desirable for better efficiency. The Railway Board being companypetent to effect necessary changes in the staff pattern of the various units under its companytrol for the purpose of streamlining the Organisation and improving their efficiency, took this decision for this purpose which is companysistent with the view of the staff Council representing the interest of the entire staff in the P.C.O. It does appear that the railway administration did want at one time to treat all units in the P.C.O. as separate permanent cadres but practical difficulty in the implementation of that policy and opposition by the staff impelled it to give up the same. Even here we find that while those already in the Inspection Wing want to remain there permanently, the others who are in the shop floor and would be denied the prospect of being taken in the Inspection Wing of the P.C.O. if the respondents companytention is upheld, are opposed to this view. The decision of the Railway Board, therefore, takes into account all points of view and makes an attempt to reconcile the companyflicting interests while ensuring improvement in the efficiency of the unit. If as a matter of policy the Railway Board approved the proposal made by the management of the Integral Coach Factory to treat the Progress Wing alone of the P.C.O. as a separate cadre and number so the remaining wings including the Inspection Wing, the same cannot be faulted unless it is held to be discriminatory or arbitrary. In view of the nature of functions performed by the four different wings of the P.C.O., we are unable to agree with the High Courts view that the Inspection Wing and the Progress Wing of the P.C.O. must be classified together and treated as separate cadres. It is significant that even at some of the earlier stages, Inspection Wing was treated differently as a matter of policy. The work of the Inspection Wing, as indicated earlier on the basis of undisputed facts before us, is to inspect the quality of the manufactured products to ensure quality companytrol, while the Progress Wing is companycerned with the stage prior to manufacture of the products. For the efficiency of the Inspection Wing which performs the duty of exercising vigilance over the production for the sake of ensuring quality of the products, it is number unreasonable to think that a periodic rotation of its personnel would be companyducive to efficient functioning of the Inspection Wing. The permanency of personnel in the Inspection Wing can promote lethargy in them and may also tend to create vested interests. The possibility of change therein makes the existing personnel more vigilant to avoid any lapse which companyld be discovered by the replacement. The highest possible standards of vigilance by them is achieved by the possibility of reversion to the shop floor against their will if the required degree of efficiency and standard in performance of the duty is number maintained. The work of the Inspection Wing being at the end point with numberfurther scrutiny thereafter, rotation of its personnel is likely to promote the efficiency of the unit. This factor is sufficient to provide a reasonable basis for classification of the Inspection Wing differently from the Progress Wing and there is numberground to companyplain of discrimination, if according to the Railway Boards policy, the Inspection Wing is number treated as a separate cadre like the Progress Wing. The power of the railway administration to formulate such a policy provided it is number discriminatory being rightly number challenged, this companyclusion alone is sufficient to uphold the action of the railway administration. The companytrary view taken by the High Court cannot, therefore, be sustained. We find that the companypetence of the Railway Board to change the staff pattern of the P.C.O. in the Kharagpur Railway Workshop of South Eastern Railway, was challenged before the Central Administrative Tribunal. The decision there was companytained in a Memorandum of 1979 declaring that the posts in the P.C.O. in the Kharagpur Railway Workshop would be treated as ex-cadre differently from the policy in Integral Coach Factory. The Tribunal rejected the challenge based on discrimination between two units and a special leave petition filed in this Court was dismissed. This Court in S.K. Chakraborthy and Ors. v. Union of India Ors., 1988 Supp. 1 S.C.R. 425 upheld the authority of the Railway Board to adopt such a policy to bring about the necessary changes in the staff pattern for improving the efficiency of the administration of units under its companytrol and for the purpose of streamlining the Organisation provided there was numberdiscrimination. Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside resulting in the dismissal of the Writ Petition filed in the High Court. No companyts. A companyy of this judgment be sent to the Chairman, Railway Board as directed.'"
